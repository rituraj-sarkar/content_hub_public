## Writing a Good Justification

A good justification is **thorough yet concise**, consistent with the ranking, and helps in improving the model. Below are specific guidelines to write a strong justification.

## Justification Guidelines

| **Guideline**                              | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Start with a Conclusion**                | Begin the justification by clearly stating which response is better based on the Likert scale. Example: *"Response 1 is better than Response 2 because..."*                                                                                       |
| **Provide Supporting Claims and Evidence** | - Each claim must be tied to a **dimension rating** and supported by evidence, such as excerpts from the responses or paraphrasing.  - Ensure that the reader can understand the justification **without referring back** to the original prompt. |
| **Be Thorough Yet Concise**                | - Highlight dimensions where the two responses **scored differently** and provide evidence.  - Identify dimensions where both responses performed **poorly**, if applicable.  - Note any **factual inaccuracies** in the responses.               |
| **Focus on Key Differences**               | While it is not necessary to cover every dimension, explain the **difference in the most impactful dimension**.                                                                                                                                   |
| **Maintain Consistency with Rankings**     | Ensure the justification **aligns with the preference ranking** (e.g., do not claim Response 1 is better if a Likert rating of 5 suggests otherwise).                                                                                             |
| **Use Correct Grammar**                    | Ensure **proper grammar and sentence structure** in your justification. Always double-check for accuracy.                                                                                                                                         |
| **Third-Person Perspective**               | Justifications must always be written in the **third person**.                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## Example Justifications

:::info
**Example 1**\*\*&#x20;

*Response 1 is much better than Response 2. Response 1 accurately describes the significance of Gore, noting its atmospheric shift and the band's evolution from nu-metal. On the other hand, Response 2 includes many factual inaccuracies, ignores the prompt's request, and is incoherent.*

**Example 2**
*Response A is more collaborative than Response B. Response B focused on answering the user's query directly but did not consider the need to understand the user's goal more precisely. In contrast, Response A approached the query from a different angle by making an assumption about the user's need, and also specifically identifying 'Costco Pharmacy' as a potential focus.*

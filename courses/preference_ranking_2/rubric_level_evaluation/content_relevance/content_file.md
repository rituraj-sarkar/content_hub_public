Cameras have evolved significantly since their invention in the early 19th century. The first photographic camera, known as the camera obscura, projected images onto surfaces but couldn't capture them. Mirrorless cameras are gaining popularity due to their compact size and fast autofocus, while DSLRs remain favorites for professional photographers because of their optical viewfinders and extensive lens options. In low-light photography, larger sensors and wider aperture lenses help capture more light, reducing noise. <br /><br />  ———————————————————————                                                                                               <br /><br />**The response includes irrelevant information about cameras, their evolution and some different types.

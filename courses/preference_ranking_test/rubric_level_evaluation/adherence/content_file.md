**Adherence** <br /><br />
This is to check if the model follows all explicit and implicit instructions given in the prompt. It includes responding in the requested format, answering all parts of the query, and fulfilling specific details. Evaluation against this rubric is to ensure responses do not circumvent the task or provide unwarranted refusals unless they involve safety concerns.

| **Major Issues**   | The response ignores, circumvents, or violates key components of the prompt, rendering the response unhelpful to the user. <br /><br />      | **Prompt** <br /> Give me a list of cheapest direct flights from London to Thessaloniki for 2 adults and 1 infant which will sit on my lap after the end of February 2024. Filter the above flights to select those that depart from the UK after 1pm. <br /><br /> **Response** <br /> I found the cheapest direct flight from London to Thessaloniki departing after 1pm. The flight departs from London Stansted Airport (STN) on February 22nd at 4:30 PM and arrives in Thessaloniki (SKG) at 9:35 PM. The flight is with Ryanair and costs $301 for 2 adults. <br /><br /> **The response does not give:** <br /> 1. A list of flights for comparison. <br /> 2. Does not consider the infant and gives cost details for only 2 adults. <br /> 3. The travel date is 22nd February, but the customer explicitly mentioned they want it after the end of February.                                                                                                                                                     |

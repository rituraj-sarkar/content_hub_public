## Likert Scale Ranking System

Once the responses are individually evaluated against the rubrics discussed in the previous sections, they are compared and ranked to identify which one is better. This ranking is done using a **Likert Scale**—a widely accepted industry standard for ranking responses. It helps in converting subjective opinions into quantitative data. A Likert Scale typically consists of a **5- or 7-point rating system**.

### Likert Scale Ranking

Typically, two responses—**Response A** and **Response B**—are ranked using the following scale:

| **1**                       | **2**                  | **3**                           | **4**                          | **5**                           | **6**                  | **7**                       |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| A is **much better** than B | A is **better** than B | A is **slightly better** than B | A and B are **about the same** | B is **slightly better** than A | B is **better** than A | B is **much better** than A |

Similar to well-defined criteria for individual rubrics discussed earlier, **preference ranking** follows a set of objective criteria. The table below explains the ranking nuances in detail.

| **Slightly Better** | • The difference in ratings for the rubric - ‘Overall Quality’ between the responses should be no more than 1 point.<br />• Use this when one response is noticeably better than the other, but not by a large margin.<br />• When both responses have issues but one has comparatively lesser.                                                                       | • Response A has a minor issues with one rubric (e.g. Truthfulness) and Response B has a major issue with the same rubric (e.g. Truthfulness), Response A is slightly better than Response B. <br />• Response A has 4 minor issues with overall response quality 'C' and Response B has 1 major issue with overall response quality 'D', Response A is slightly better than Response B. <br />• Response A has 2 major issues and Response B has 4 major issues -both would be rated 'E' in overall response quality, but Response A is slightly better than Response B. |
| **Better**          | • Response A has 4 minor issues with overall response quality 'C' and Response B has 1 major issue with overall response quality 'D', Response A is slightly better than Response B. <br />• Response A has 2 major issues and Response B has 4 major issues -both would be rated 'E' in overall response quality, but Response A is slightly better than Response B. | • Response A has no issues with overall response quality 'A' and Response B has 4 minor issues with overall response quality 'C', Response A is better than Response B. <br />• Response A has few minor issues with overall response quality 'B' and Response B has one major issue with overall response quality 'D', Response A is better than Response B.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Much Better**     | • If one response is entirely correct while the other has multiple (2 or more) major issues. <br />• Choose this when there is a significant quality gap between the two responses.                                                                                                                                                                                   | • Response A has three major issues with overall response quality 'E' and Response B has no issues with overall response quality 'A', Response B is much better than Response A.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **About the Same**  | • Use this when both responses have an equal score on the overall response quality rubric due to the same number of major or minor issues. <br />• Use this when both responses are so poor/so good that selecting a winner is not justified.                                                                                                                         | • Response A has three minor issues with overall response quality 'C' and Response B has three minor issues as well with overall response quality 'C', Response A and B are about the same.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
